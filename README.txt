No tutorial for this one, I will be using notes from the SFML tutorials.

COMPILE COMMAND:
   - bsfml main.cpp Calc.cpp Components/Button.cpp calc


NOTES:
   - The picture to go off of is inspoPics/inspo2.png (blue one on the far right)
   - Another one is inspo3, the blue calculator again


CURRENT:
   - We have output on the screen, it's static, and it's not in the right position
