No tutorial for this one, I will be using notes from the SFML tutorials.


NOTES:
   - The picture to go off of is inspoPics/inspo2.png (blue one on the far right)
   - Another one is inspo3, the blue calculator again


CURRENT:
   - Getting a black rectangular screen to pop up, should be the boundary of the calc

FIGMA:
   - It looked better to make the boxes 70x70 and make the spacing 12.5 between
   so do that
